+ 2024 season complete
+ full results for 3 series

TODO:

+ test datasets:
    - if the last Race in the dataset has 1 row, then the website has
        only used a placeholder for the upcoming race
    - that placeholder row needs to be removed prior to updating the series
    - set a check for nrow() of max(Season) max(Race) to avoid this issue
+ add success email to GitHub actions yml file
