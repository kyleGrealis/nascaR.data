## In the Pits

NASCAR is one of the top-tier racing sports in North America and competes against Formula-1 and IndyCar for the top viewership spot. Approximately 3.22 million people watch a race on any given weekend throughout the season. The nascaR.data package is the result of wanting to share a passion for the sport and provide an option to the typical go-to packages when learning new data cleaning & visualization tools.

## Data Structure

The package provides three main datasets:

* `cup_series`: NASCAR Cup Series race results (1949-present)
* `xfinity_series`: NASCAR Xfinity Series race results (1982-present)
* `truck_series`: NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series results (1995-present)

Each dataset contains detailed race information including:

* Race details (Season, Race number, Track, Name)
* Results (Finish position, Start position)
* Performance metrics (Laps completed, Laps led, Points earned)
* Driver and team information

Data is sourced with permission from DriverAverages.com and is automatically updated every Monday at 5AM EST during the racing season (February through November).

## Usage

Load the package:

```r
library(nascaR.data)
```
