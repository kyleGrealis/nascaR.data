\title{Load NASCAR Series Data}
\usage{
load_series(series = c("cup", "xfinity", "truck"), refresh = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{Character. The series to load. One of \code{"cup"},
\code{"xfinity"}, or \code{"truck"}.}

\item{refresh}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, bypass the cache and
re-download from cloud storage. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with race results containing columns:
Season, Race, Track, Name, Length, Surface, Finish, Start,
Car, Driver, Team, Make, Pts, Laps, Led, Status, S1, S2,
Rating, and Win.
}
\description{
Downloads NASCAR series data from Cloudflare R2 as a parquet file.
Uses two-tier caching (memory + disk) for performance. On first
call, data is downloaded and cached locally. Subsequent calls
return cached data instantly.
}
\details{
Requires the \code{arrow} package to read parquet files. If \code{arrow}
is not installed, you will be prompted to install it.
\subsection{Caching}{

Data is cached in two tiers:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Memory}: Instant access within the current R session.
\item \strong{Disk}: Persists across sessions at the CRAN-approved
location returned by
\code{tools::R_user_dir("nascaR.data", which = "cache")}.
}

Use \code{refresh = TRUE} to force a fresh download, or
\code{\link[=clear_cache]{clear_cache()}} to remove all cached data.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load Cup Series data (downloads on first call, cached after)
cup <- load_series("cup")

# Load Xfinity Series data
xfinity <- load_series("xfinity")

# Load Truck Series data
truck <- load_series("truck")

# Force re-download from cloud storage
cup <- load_series("cup", refresh = TRUE)
}

}
